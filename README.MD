A few notes.

I didn't have sufficient time to resolve the N:N issues between Person N:N Address and Person N:N Religion. Nor did I deal with the same N:N issues between Student N:N Accomodations and Student N:N High School. Because I dealt with this for Student N:N CourseInstance, creating "Enrollment" and Enrollment N:N GradeScale, creatincg EnrollmentGrade, I assume I've demonstrated sufficiently how to Normalize--at least at that basic level. (The ones unresolved were not used for the SQL queries, so I optimized my time.

I didn't outwardly list PK and FK relationships in the diagram. This was also a time constraint issue.

You would be totally within your rights to say "you should have spent less time commenting and more time working." :D I'll take that. My response is "better to show you how I'm thinking with comments than to simply put everything on paper and not give you insight to me brain.

That said, Good luck.
